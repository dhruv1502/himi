description

A true floral signature, the Dolce&Gabbana Dolce EDP presents an elegant vision of romance. The feminine fragrance is inspired by the legendarily noble beauty of Sicily, its gardens abundant with fresh white blooms. Pairing the best of vintage glamour with a contemporary edge, Dolce is a timeless EDP, presented in a beautiful bottle and topped with a marzipan flower reminiscent of those seen in the windows of Sicilian confectioners. Dolce opens with a bright and uplifting burst of neroli and papaya flower, sweet yet refined. The centrepiece is the full bodied white amaryllis, a flower used for the first time in perfumery, captured using a process as complex and extraordinary as the fine embroidery of a dress. In the dry down, a smooth and sensuous trail of musk and cashmeran leaves a lasting impression.
